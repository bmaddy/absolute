  <dc:description>Several nonprofit umbrella associations have implemented assessment and
            certification programs intending to produce institutional improvement for member
            organizations. An analysis of semi-structured interviews guided by institutional theory,
            reveals factors that differentiate among organizations that chose to participate in one
            such program (the Louisiana Standards for Excellence organizational assessment) and
            those that did not. Drawing on organizational learning and accountability literatures,
            the research investigates the antecedents and consequences of accreditation in
            nonprofits. Results indicate that, integrity-enhancement, continuous improvement and
            financial motives drive the decision to seek accreditation, and outcomes of
            remediation-oriented process improvement initiatives were contingent upon staff
            commitment.</dc:description>
