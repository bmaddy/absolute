            <head>What About College?</head>
            <p> COLLEGE.-TRAINED leaders guided this country to victory in the recent war.
               Government statistics show vividly how this nation turned, as did other nations, to
               the product of its higher educational institutions for leadership, without which the
               valor of its soldiers and sailors would have been unavailing.</p>
            <p>But the war served only to emphasize a peace-time truth. The college trained men are
               the leaders in peace no less than in war.</p>
            <p>For years we have demanded special training for ministers, physicians. surgeons and
               lawyers. Professional men are college men.</p>
            <p>And now the business world is demanding college training for its men and women, that
               they may strive better in the competition of present day industrialism. A college
               education has become as essential for a successful career in business, politics and
               social work, with their hundreds of ramifications, as it is in the professions and in
               engineering.</p>
            <p>This booklet is sent to you so that you may know about Western Reserve University as
               you make your plans for a college education. Western Reserve can train you either in
               the law, medical, dental and teaching professions, or for the business world.</p>
            <p>A University offers opportunities which a college, whether it be large or small,
               cannot offer. Not only docs it aid in specialization, but also it gives that rounded
               development and general culture which are the marks of a well-educated man or
               woman.</p>
            <p>If the University is located in a city, the advantages are multiplied.as
               opportunities for contacts and associations of the most varied character are offered.
               The student is surrounded by a vast laboratory in which to study and to become
               familiar with the vital elements in the organization of modern society. Moral
               development is individual, and the city brings to the student no greater temptations
               than the small town, while it gives him better and safer opportunities for utilizing
               that energy which otherwise might be ill-directed.</p>
            <p>Western Reserve wants you if it can meet your need. Tell us about that need. Address
               the Executive Secretary of the University.</p>
            <p>You should keep this booklet for future information.</p>

               been remodeled for auxiliary purposes, and adequate showers, lockers and equipment

               recreational gymnastics throughout his college course. Universal participation in
               athletic events as well as specialization by a few will be the aim. Inter-class,
               inter-fraternity and other teams will furnish the material from which the football,

            <p>There are at Western Reserve undergraduate, professional, and honorary fraternities
               as given below. The undergraduate chapters at Adelbert College are-united hv an Inter
               fraternity Council, which determines "rushing" rules and cares for other matters of
               common interest. There is close cooperation between the council and the college
               faculty. The chapters compete for the Interfraternity Scholarship Trophy, awarded by
               the Dean each semester.</p>

            <p>The first department of Western Reserve University was established at Hudson, Ohio, in
               1826, as Western Reserve College. Removed to Cleveland in 1882, it became Adelbert
               College of Western Reserve University. Other departments were presently added.</p>
            <p>The University campus lies in the midst of the great park system of Cleveland. At the
               present time eighteen of the twenty-two buildings which house the University are here
               situated. Additional buildings for the Schools of Medicine and of Pharmacy are soon to
               be built, so that these departments may be transferred from their present locations in
               the midst of the city to the University group. With the athletic field, about
               thirty-seven acres are devoted to University purposes.</p>
            <p>In close proximity are the Case School of Applied Science, the Cleveland Museum of
               Art, the Cleveland Art School, the Cleveland Normal School, the Western Reserve
               Historical Society, the East End Branch of the Young Men's Christian Association, and
               other public institutions.</p>
            <p>The University and the departmental libraries represent about 135,000volumes. The
               Cleveland Public Library, of 700.000 volumes, has a branch in one of the University
               buildings.</p>
            <p>The University has 7500 alumni and 2000 alumnae and former students, a total of 9500,
               of whom 7000 are living.</p>
            <p>The normal annual enrollment of recent years has been about 1650, This does not
               include the students in the extension divisions, who number about2350, making a total
               of some 4000.</p>
            <p>Further information will be gladly furnished through the office of the several
               departments or the general office of the president.</p>
