            <description>The Hall of Progress at the Great Lakes Exposition exhibits the progress of
                science and new inventions. The Building, 540 feet long and 180 feet wide, is
                constructed entirely of wood, using a system of building known as "rigid frames,"
                used for the first time in such a large structure. The two interior courts have
                outdoor gardens</description>
